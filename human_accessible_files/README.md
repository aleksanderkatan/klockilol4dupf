So this is a project I've picked up while I was at my year 2 in college.
This is actually my fourth attempt in trying to code this game. 
First try was a c++ console app.
Second and third were GameMakerStudio 2 projects.
My licence for GameMaker expired, and I could no longer work on the third version (which actually was quite elaborate), so I've decided to write it all again with different mechanics in Python.
I purposely, from the beginning chose to not do any animations.
They may cause the game to be more clear, however I have some very traumatic memories with animations from versions second and third.
Moreover, I finally knew what I was getting into, so I wrote this in the most expandable way I could've thought of.
Level editors are hard to code, so why not just have a way to write down every level to .txt and vice versa?
So, if you want to add some more blocks or levels, feel free.

Stolen code:
- input_box from stack
- code coloring class

The (most likely) original flash game's name is
